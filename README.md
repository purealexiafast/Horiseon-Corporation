# Horiseon Corporation

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

The webpage of Horiseon Corporation was functional and nice to look at, however, the code was problematic and often incorrect. The challenge was to improve the code base by re-organizing and consolidating. I found myself at times, adding new code to take the place of pre-existing code. I learned a lot while restructuring. It was challenging to organize the CSS as there were so many duplicates of code, which made it confusing to read. However by the end of the assignment, I felt that I had accomplished all that needed to be improved upon.

### Examples of how I improved the code base:

- I consolidated duplicate elements in the CSS
- Changed class to id's when appropriate
- Changed the unordered list within the header to a nav  
- Added semantic elements such as main and footer 
- Added alt attributes to the image tags
- Made sure the headings fell in sequential order
- Added a descriptive title
- Linked the CSS file to the HTML file
- Added CSS code to improve where appropriate
- Included CSS comments to explain the changes
- Utilized the float property to place sections 

The end result of my work was a functional website that looked identical to the original but contained semantic and well organised code.
